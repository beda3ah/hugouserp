# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation files that were generated during previous development phases. These files are kept for reference but are not maintained and may contain outdated information.

## Why These Were Archived

During a comprehensive refactoring in December 2025, the project had accumulated over 45 markdown documentation files, many of which were:
- AI-generated audit summaries
- Duplicate implementation plans
- Status reports that were no longer current
- Multiple versions of the same document

To improve maintainability and reduce confusion, these files were moved to this archive directory.

## Current Documentation

For current, maintained documentation, please refer to:
- **README.md** - Installation, configuration, and quick start
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture and design patterns
- **SECURITY.md** - Security policies and best practices
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contribution guidelines
- **CRON_JOBS.md** - Scheduled jobs documentation
- **docs/ROADMAP.md** - Planned improvements and features
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Project change history

## Archived File List

The following files are archived here:
- Various SUMMARY, STATUS, and IMPLEMENTATION files
- Audit reports and checklists
- Module-specific architecture documents (superseded by main ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Frontend documentation (integrated into README.md)
- Multiple PR summaries
- Arabic translation documentation drafts

These files remain available for historical reference but should not be considered authoritative or current.
